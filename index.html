        <p>This page contains audio samples from <a

            of<br>

        <h4>Notable differences from the paper:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Trained using a batch size of 64 on a single GPU (using automatic mixed precision)</li>
            <li>Used a gradient clipping threshold of 0.05 as it seems to stabilize the alignment with the smaller batch
                size.</li>
            <li>Used a different learning rate schedule (again to deal with smaller batch size).</li>
            <li>Used <a

                to generate waveforms instead of WaveRNN. The vocoder was trained on the ground-truth spectrograms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Used 80-bin (instead of 128 bin) log-Mel spectrograms.

            but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
            number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same
            as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls.

            that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put
            together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way - all over the place.

            found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower,
            drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.

            <strong>Text:</strong> Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little
            way apart from the
            Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't
            fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a
            tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another
            one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all
            too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit
            windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering
            over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing
            pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around
            Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can - but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact,
            it was fast asleep.

            <strong>Text:</strong> Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very
            fat and hated
            exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he
            couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with
            living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller
            and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was
            about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green
            eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
            punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his
            forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first
            question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

            what time it was and
            he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen
            for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could
            remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being
            in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his
            cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his
            forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from.
            He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was
            forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry
            had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
            Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed
            to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too.

            <strong>Text:</strong> October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam
            Pomfrey, the
            nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked
            instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who
            had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair
            gave the impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle
            windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's pumpkins
            swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was
            not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before
            Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. Even aside from the
            rain and wind{1} it hadn't been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the
            Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported
            that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.
